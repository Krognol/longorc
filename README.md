(Not just a) Discord bot made with [Discordnim](https://github.com/Krognol/discordnim).

# Services

When making your own services, make a new `.nim` file in the `src` directory with the same name as the service.

All services **must** inherit these methods:

```nim
import longorc

type
    TService = ref object of Service
        # Any additional fields that are needed

method name*(s: TService): string # Service name

# For checking if the sender of a message is oneself
method isMe*(s: TService, m: OrcMessage) 

# For checking if a sender is a moderator
method isModerator(s: TService, m: OrcMessage)

# For sending a message to `at` 
# For Discord `at` is a channel ID
# while for a service like Twitch it would be 
# a IRC channel name. E.g. `#krognol`
method sendMessage*(s: TService, at: string, message: string)

# The service prefix user when invoking plugin commands
method prefix*(s: TService): string 
```

## Service Message

Messages recieved from services are handled by making a `TMessage` which inherits the following methods:

```nim
type TMessage = ref object of OrcMessage

# The message sender
method user*(m: TMessage): TUser

# The channel where the message was sent in
# For discord this is a snowflake id
# but in a service for something like Twitch IRC
# it'd be `#channel-name`
method channel*(m: TMessage): string

# The contents of the message
method content*(m: TMessage): string

# Should return a message id if one is available
method id*(m: TMessage): string

# The type of the message
# Create/Update/Delete
method msgTyp*(m: TMessage): MessageType
```

These messages are handled as `OrcMessage` types when passed to plugin methods.

## Service Users

User types **must** inherit the following methods:

```nim
type TUser = ref object of OrcUser

# The name of the user
method name*(u: TUser): string

# The ID of the user if one is available
method id*(u: TUser): string

# The users avatar link if one is available
method avatar*(u: TUser): string

# The users discriminator if one is available
method discriminator*(u: TUser): string

# Whether the user is a bot or not
method bot*(u: TUser): bool
```

## Service Plugins

Make a new folder in the `src/plugins` directory with the name of the plugin, and a `.nim` file with (preferably) the same name.

All plugins should follow this basic structure:

```nim
import ../../longorc, marshal, asyncdispatch

type
    TPlugin* = ref object of Plugin
        # Any additional fields it may need

method name*(p: TPlugin): string = "tplugin"
method save*(p: TPlugin) = 
    # If something needs to be saved
    writeFile("tpluginstate.json", $$p)
    # else we'll just return and do nothing

method load*(p: TPlugin) =
    # If something needs to loaded
    let body = readFile("tpluginstate.json")
    let temp = marshal.to[TPlugin](body)
    p.fields = temp.fields
    # else we'll just return and do nothing

method help*(p: TPlugin, b: Bot, s: Service, m: OrcMessage): seq[string] =
    # Returns a seq of strings that describes the commands this plugin supports
    result = @[
        longorc.commandHelp("cmd name", "cmd args", "cmd help text")
    ]

method message*(p: TPlugin, b: Bot, s: Service, m: OrcMessage) {.async.} =
    # Message handling
    # If we want to check if a message matches a prefix and a command
    if matchesCommand(m, s, "cmd name"):
        # It matches and we can now parse it 
        let (rest, args) = parseCommand(s, m)
        # `rest` is either everything after the initial `cmd name` or empty
        # while `args` is everything after the initial `cmd name` split by spaces.
        if rest == "something": 
            # Do something
            return
        
        case args[0]:
        of "something else": 
            # Do something
        else: discard

proc newTPlugin(#[Any necessary args]#): TPlugin = 
    # If the plugin doesn't have a `state` that needs to be loaded
    # we'll just return a new TPlugin.
    result = TPlugin()

    # If we however do need to load the plugin from a state
    # we'll call the plugins `load` method.
    # and use `marshal.to[TPlugin](filebody)`
    # and return that.
    p.load()
```

All plugins **must** inherit the following methods:
```nim
method name*(p: TPlugin): string # Name of the plugin
method save*(p: TPlugin) # For saving any long term data
method load*(p: TPlugin) # For loading any long term data

# For displaying help messages about commands
method help*(p: TPlugin, b: longorc.Bot, s: longorc.Service, m: longorc.OrcMessage): seq[string] 

# For message handling
method message*(p: TPlugin, b: longorc.Bot, s: longorc.Service, m: longorc.OrcMessage) {.async.} 
```

# Commands

Most of these commands are fitted for Discord, but should be pretty easy to modify for other services.
